# Lesson 1: Introduction to hypothesis testing?

## What is hypothesis testing?

-   Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to make inferences or draw conclusions about a population based on sample data.

-   It involves evaluating two competing hypotheses to determine if there is enough evidence to support a particular claim.

## Key Concepts in Hypothesis Testing

:::::: columns
::::: incremental
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Null Hypothesis (H₀)**

-   A statement suggesting no effect, no difference, or no relationship exists. This is the hypothesis that is tested.

-   Example: "There is no difference in the average test scores between two groups."
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Alternative Hypothesis (H₁ or Ha)**

-   A statement that contradicts the null hypothesis, proposing that there is a significant effect or difference.

-   Example: "There is a significant difference in the average test scores between two groups."

::::::

## Steps in Hypothesis Testing

::: incremental
1.  **State the hypotheses**: Define H₀ and H₁.

2.  **Choose a significance level (α)**: Common choices are 0.05 or 0.01. This determines the threshold for rejecting H₀.

3.  **Select the appropriate test**: Based on the data type and hypotheses (e.g., t-test, ANOVA).

4.  **Compute the test statistic**: This involves calculating a value that measures the difference between the sample data and the null hypothesis.

5.  **Make a decision**:

-   Reject H₀ if the test statistic shows significant evidence against H₀ (i.e., p-value \< α).
-   Fail to reject H₀ if there is not enough evidence (i.e., p-value ≥ α).
:::

## Types of Errors

:::::: columns
::::: incremental
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Type I Error (False Positive)**

-   Rejecting H₀ when it is actually true.

-   Example: Concluding there is a difference when there isn’t.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Type II Error (False Negative)**

-   Failing to reject H₀ when it is false.

-   Example: Concluding there is no difference when there actually is.
:::
:::::
::::::

## Test Statistic and P-Value

-   The test statistic is a value calculated from the sample data used to decide whether to reject the null hypothesis.

-   The p-value is the probability of obtaining a result at least as extreme as the one observed, given that H₀ is true.

    -   If p-value \< α, reject H₀; otherwise, fail to reject H₀.

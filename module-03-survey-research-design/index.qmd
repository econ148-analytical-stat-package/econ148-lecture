# Lesson 1: Methods of data collection

## Introduction

Appropriate measurement of variables is needed in studying behavior.

-   Quantitative - numerical values

-   Qualitative - can be grouped and assigned numerical values

## Note

::: incremental
-   Use of faulty data results in misleading conclusions
-   Research processes call for objectivity, integrity, and analytical rigor.
-   Data should be accurate as possible; free from error, bias, and subjectivity.
:::

:::::

## Methods of data collection

-   Census and survey method

-   Observation method

-   Experimental method

## Methods of data collection

### Census and survey method

> collect data directly from the subject of the study (respondent units or informants) using a pre-constructed set of questions (questionnaire)

::: incremental
-   **Census**

    -   data collection from all units of a population

    -   e.g., population census and housing

-   **Survey**

    -   data collection from a sample of units from a population

    -   e.g., family income and expenditure survey, annual poverty inficator survey
:::

## Methods of data collection

### Observation method

> records data as things occur, making use of an appropriate and accepted method of measurement

-   e.g., person's blood pressure, number of new covid cases, number of typhoons in a year

## Methods of data collection

### Experimental method

> collect data through well designed and controlled statistical experiments where the goal is keeping all others constant so as to leave the effect of several studied variables to be shown in the observed measurement in the dependent variable

-   e.g., effect of fertilizer on soil quality, effect of a specific teaching methodology on school performance, effect of universal basic income on welfare measures

## Tools of data collection

### Questionnaire approach

> set a pre-specified questions; replies are recorded by respondentes. Assumes that respondent is capable of understanding and answering the questions by him/herself without influence from investigator/enumerator.

-   respondent-bias is minimized by keeping questions simple and direct, i.e., yes/no/can't say, good/satisfactory/unsatisfactory

## Tools of data collection

### Data types

-   **Primary data**

    -   data collected through surveys and census are called primary

    -   They are collected afresh.

-   **Secondary data**

    -   data on subjects or observations already collected by someone else (e.g., government agencies, research institutions, and other organizations)

## Tools of data collection

### Errors in data

::: incremental
-   **Sampling error**

    -   arises because because of misrepresentation of the population through the sample.

-   **Measurement error**

    -   faulty measurement from lack of clarity about what is to be measured or how it is measured

-   **Non-sampling error**

    -   omission of information or non-response

-   **Total survey error**

    -   summation of all possible errors
:::

# Lesson 2: Sampling design in surveys

## Sampling design

### Non-random sampling

> selection of respondent units does not depend on randomness but on some other criteria

::: {.callout-note style="font-size: 1.0em;"}
non-random samples do not provide representativeness, and is only useful for exploratory research.
:::

## Sampling design

### Non-random sampling

::: incremental
-   **Purposive sample**

    -   selecting observations based on one's expert knowledge or judgement

-   **Convenience sample**

    -   taking observations that are conveniently located in the perspective of the investigator.

-   **Snowball sample**

    -   relies on referrals from initial respondents to generate additional respondents
:::

## Sampling design

::: callout-note
## Purposive sampling

**Example**: A researcher wants to study the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of frontliners. The researcher selects frontliners who have been working in the hospital for more than 6 months and have been exposed to COVID-19 patients.

**Example**: A researcher studying the experiences of undocumented immigrants might purposefully select participants who have been in the country for varying lengths of time, have different levels of education, and come from various regions. This allows for a diverse range of experiences to be explored.
:::

## Sampling design

::: callout-note
## Convenience sampling

**Example**: A psychology student conducting a study on college student stress might survey students in their own classes or residence hall. This is convenient because it requires minimal effort to recruit participants.

**Example**: A market researcher wants to quickly gather feedback on a new product. They set up a booth at a local mall and ask people passing by to fill out a short survey. This is a convenient way to collect data quickly, as the researcher can easily access a large number of people in a short amount of time.

**Note**: method may not be representative of the entire population, as the people who happen to be at the mall at that time may not be a typical cross-section of the population.
:::

## Sampling design

::: callout-note
## Snowball sampling

**Example**: A sociologist studying a marginalized community might start with a few initial participants and ask them to refer other people who might be willing to participate in the study. This can be effective for reaching hard-to-reach populations.

**Example**: A researcher studying the experiences of LGBTQ+ individuals in a conservative community might start by interviewing one person who is open about their identity. This person might then refer the researcher to other LGBTQ+ individuals in the community, who can refer the researcher to others, and so on.
:::

## Sampling design

### Random sampling

> provides samples that are representative of the population. It is a method of sampling in which each unit in the population has a determined chance of being included in the sample.

::: incremental
-   with a random sample, we can infer the results to the population and indicate the extent of error to which the estimates are the subject (i.e., precision estimate).

-   with a random sample, the sample statistics derived from the sample are random variables themeselves, given that the composition of observation can vary.
:::

## Sampling design

### Simple random sampling with replacement

> each unit in the population has an equal chance of being selected in the sample and each sample has an equal probability of getting selected.

::: incremental
-   select $\text{n}$ number units from a population $\text{N}$ units

-   we select the first unit of observation at random, note its particulars for colelction of data and place it back in the population.

-   repeat $\text{n}$ times, each unit in the population has the probability of $1/N^n$ being choses into the sample.

-   can use a table of random numbers or the random number generator
:::

## Sampling design

::: callout-tip
## Example in R

Using four six-sided dice, let's randomly select four numbers between 1 and 6 with replacement. Samping with replacement simply means that each number is "replaced" after it is selected, so that the same number can show up more thant once.

## random sample with replacement
sample(1:6, 4, replace = TRUE)
```

## Sampling design

### Simple random sampling without replacement

> similar with random sampling with replacement, but the selected unit is not replaced back in the population, i.e., no unit gets repeated in the sample.

## Short practice exercise

1.  Write R code to create a population of 100 numbers and sample 10 numbers without replacement.

2.  Write R code to sample 5 numbers from the population {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} with replacement.
:::

## Sampling design

### Systematic sampling

> selecting a sample from a larger population at a regular intervals

-   let $\text{k}$ be the integer nearest to the quotient $\text{N/n}$

-   select a starting point $\text{r}$ which is between $\text{1}$ and $\text{k}$, with will be called the $\text{r}^{th}$ unit or $U_r$

-   sample will then be a set of compose of $U_r, U_{r+k}, U_{r+2k}, \ldots, U_{r+(n-1)k}$

## Sampling design

::: callout-tip
## Steps in Systematic sampling in R

1.  Define the population $\text{N}$ and sample size $\text{n}$

2.  Calculate the interval $\text{k}$

3.  Set a random starting point $\text{r}$

4.  Generate sample indices

5.  Extract sample values
:::

## Sampling design

::: callout-tip
## Example in R

Supposed you have a population of 100 students and want to select a sample of 20.

1.  Population size $\text{N} = 100$ and Sample size $\text{n} = 20$

2.  Sampling interval $\text{k} = \text{N/n} = 100/20 = 5$

3.  Set a random starting point $\text{r} = 3$ (randomly chosen between 1 and 5)
:::

## Sampling design

n <- 20

# Calculate the interval (k)
k <- N / n

# Set a random starting point (r)
set.seed(123) # set seed for reproducibility
r <- sample(1:k, 1)

# Generate sample indices
sample_indices <- seq(r, N, k)

# Extract sample values
sample_values <- sample_indices

print(sample_values)
```

## Sampling design

::: callout-important
## Short practice exercise

1.  A population of 1000 individuals is to be sampled using systematic sampling. The sample size is 50. Calculate the sampling interval.

2.  Write an R code to randomly select a starting point (r) between 1 and the calculated sampling interval (k).

3.  Using the calculated sampling interval (k) and the randomly selected starting point (r), generate the sample indices.
:::

## Sampling design

### Stratified sampling

> probability of selection of a unit is porportional to a given measure of its size and this measure may be a characteristic related to a given measure of its size.

::: incremental
-   **proportional sampling**

    -   weigh the sample observations with suitable weights at the estimation stage to obtain unbiased estimates of population parameters, the weights being the probabilities of selection units.

-   **disproportional sampling**

    -   takes into account the variability of each subgroup, adding more observations to subgroups that are more variable.
:::

## Sampling design

::: callout-tip
## Example in R

**Proportional sampling**

Scenario:

Let's assume we have a population of 100 students divided into three strata:

-   Stratum 1: Freshmen (30 students)

-   Stratum 2: Sophomores (40 students)

-   Stratum 3: Juniors and Seniors (30 students)

We want to draw a sample of 20 students proportionally from each stratum.
:::

## Sampling design

::: callout-tip
## Example in R

**Proportional sampling**
:::

```{r}
#| echo: true

# Create a data frame to represent the population
library(tidyverse)

population <- tibble(
  stratum = rep(c("Freshman", "Sophomore", "JuniorSenior"), times = c(30, 40, 30)),
  id = 1:100
)

# Set the total sample size
total_sample_size <- 20

# Calculate the sample size for each stratum proportionally
strata_sample_sizes <- population |>  
  count(stratum) |>  
  mutate(prop = n / sum(n),
         sample_size = round(prop * total_sample_size))

# Sample from each stratum

  left_join(strata_sample_sizes, by = "stratum") |> 
  group_by(stratum) |> 
  group_map(~ slice_sample(.x, n = .x$sample_size[1])) |> 
  bind_rows()

# Print the sample
print(sample_data)
```

## Sampling design

::: callout-tip
## Example in R

**Disproportional sampling**
:::

```{r}
#| echo: true

# ... (same population data frame as before)

# Set the total sample size
total_sample_size <- 20

# Define the sampling ratios
sampling_ratios <- c(0.5, 0.3, 0.2)

# Calculate sample sizes for each stratum based on the specified ratios
disproportional_sample_sizes <- tibble(
  stratum = c("Freshman", "Sophomore", "JuniorSenior"),
  sample_size = round(sampling_ratios * total_sample_size)
)

# Perform the disproportional sampling
sample_data <- population |> 
  left_join(disproportional_sample_sizes, by = "stratum") |> 
  group_by(stratum) |> 
  group_map(~ slice_sample(.x, n = .x$sample_size[1])) |> 
  bind_rows()

# Print the sample
print(sample_data)

### Cluster sampling

> use when subgroups are mutually heterogenous but are internally heterogenous.

-   e.g., all inhabitant in a municipality from part of a population, barangays can serve as clusters wherein its inhabitant can serve as observations.

-   We have a 1000 population of individuals spread across several barangays.

-   We’ll randomly select 3 barangays (clusters) and then sample individuals within each selected barangay.

### Sample size determination requirements

-   **Margin of error** $E$

    -   maximum allowable/tolerable error, the error that comes due to sampling.

-   **Variance of the population of interest (**$\sigma^2$)

    -   usually unknown but usually stable over time, information can be derived from official studies or census.

-   **Perceived value of proportion (**$p$)

    -   the ratio at which the characteristics being studied is present in the population.

## Sampling design

:::: callout-note
## Take note

::: incremental
-   Confidence level shows the pecentage of times when the true population parameter is observed in the calculated confidence interval.

-   Margin of error is the value that is added or subtracted to the sample statistic in order to create an interval estimate.

-   In estimating proportions, the confidence interval and margin of error need not to be complementary; one can have a confidence level of 95% and a margin of error of 5% or a margin of error of 4%, depending on the researcher.

-   In estimating means, the margin of error will not be a percentage but in the units of the variable which mean is to be predicted; the smaller the margin of error, the more precise will be the interval estimate.

### Margin of error formula

$$
\text{confidence interval} = \bar{X} \pm Z_{\alpha /2} \times \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}
$$

$$
\text{margin of error (E)} = Z_{\alpha /2} \times \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}
$$

## Example

A local government wishes to look at the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on SMEs income across town. Before the pandemic it was able to capture information on incomes of SMEs, the annual average income was 600,000 with a standard deviation of 140,000. Setting a margin of error of 30,000 and a confidence level of 95%, how many individual entrepreneurs will be surveyed in order to get a representative sample of the town's SME population?

## General comments in sample size determination

-   The higher the confidence level, the larger the sample size needed.

-   The smaller the margin of errror, the larger the sample size needed.

-   Sample can also depend on the budget, time, and resources available for the study.

-   Modern research uses power analysis in determining sample size. It is a method of determining the number of observations needed to detect an effect of a given size with a given level of confidence.

## Measurement

-   Research begins with a problem or topic, thinking about the problems results in identifying concepts that capture the phenomenon being examined.

-   Abstract concepts and attributes should be measured carefully to be of use in the empirical level.

-   Measurement is the process of assigning numbers to represent quantities of attributes.

-   Rules for assigning numbers need to be standardized and uniformly applicable.

## Measurement

::: callout-note
## Measurement issues in research

-   Whether underlying characteristics of the concept allows ordering (ordinal level or categorizing (nominal level)?

-   Whether the features of the concepts are discrete or constinuos with fine gradation?

-   Concepts can be measured by more than one indicator. How many indicators are appropriate to measure a concept?

-   Are measure valid and reliable?

## Criteria for good measurement

-   **Reliability**

    -   is the measurement able to consistently lead to same conclusion?

    -   clearly define how observations will be counted; make sure that questions are phrased for all respondents.

## Criteria for good measurement

-   **Validity**

    -   the extent to which a measure captures the concept it is intended to measure.

    -   check how your measurements corresponds to established theories or other measures in literature

    -   make sure to have appropriate number of observations that will represent the population

## Steps in questinnaire construction

-   Determination of questionnaire content

-   Framing the questions and accompanying instructions

-   Composing the form by deciding on the layout

-   Constructing the draft questionnaire (and making revisions if necessary)

-   Reproduction of the final questionnaire

## Questions and statements

-   Questionnaire - a collection of questions and statements

-   Statements - stated for the respondents to agree or disagree with.

    -   Likert scale (Rensis Likert) - formalized procedure of asking respondents their response to a statement such as strongly agree, agree, disagree, and strongly disagree (and the like)

    -   Likert - type scale has no neutral option in the middle

## Open-ended vs closed-ended questions

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Open-ended questions**

-   the respondents provides his/her own answer to the question

-   e.g., "What is your opinion on the government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic?"
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Close-ended questions**

-   the respondents chooses from a list of pre-defined answers.

-   e.g., "Do you agree or disagree with the government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic?"

    -   Agree, Disagree, Neutral, Can't say, etc.
:::
:::::

## Open-ended questions

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Advantages**

-   Can be used when all possible response categories are not known

-   Allow more detail, clarification, and qualification on the responses

-   Can be used when there are too many potential answer categories to list

-   Preferable for complex issues

-   Allow more opportunity for exploitation and self- expression.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Disadvantages**

-   May lead to collection of worthless/irrelevant information

-   Data are not standard from person to person

-   Low intercoder readability

-   Require superior respondent writing/speaking skills

-   Questions may be too general for respondent to understand.
:::
:::::

## Close-ended questions

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Advantages**

-   Comparability of answers

-   Easier to code

-   Item meaning is clearer

-   Answers tend to be complete and relevant

-   Greater inclination to answer sensitive questions

-   Easier to understand
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Disadvantages**\

-   Guessing or “random” answering

-   Inappropriate or irrelevant response categories

-   Too many categories

-   Undetected differences in interpretation

-   Less variation in responses

-   Higher likelihood of clerical error.

## Questionnaire formats for respondents

-   Ordering questions in a questionnaire can affect the answers given.

-   Do not randomize the order of questions.

-   Be sensitive to the effect of the ordering of the questions.

-   For self-administered questionnaires, begin with the most interesting set of questions. Requests for duller, demographic data should generally be placed at the end.

-   For interviews, do the opposite. The interviewer might gain rapport quickly by introducing briefly the study and getting demographic data afterwards.

## Questionnaire formats for respondents

-   Every questionnaire, whether self- administered or interview schedule, must contain clear instructions and introductory statements where appropriate.

-   For self-administered questionnaires, basic instructions as to how to complete the questionnaire is useful.

-   If the questionnaire is arranged into sub- sections, introduce each section with a short statement concerning its content and purpose.

## Questionnaire formats for respondents

-   For closed-ended questions, make clear instructions as to whether the respondents should choose only 1 or can select as many as he/she can.

-   When a set of answer categories are to be rank-ordered by the respondent, instructions should be clear as how to do the ranking, and how many answers are to be ranked.

## Basics of interviewing

### Phases of the interview process

-   Identification and Introduction of the Interviewer

-   Explanation of the Nature and Purpose of the Survey

-   Getting the Respondent to Initially Cooperate or Establishing Rapport

-   Interview Proper

-   Formal Closing of the Interview

## Basics of interviewing

### Interviewer attitudes

-   The job is important.

-   He must follow instructions.

-   Biases affect the quality of the data.

-   He is a professional.

-   He is a guest in someone’s home and thus treat the respondent with courtesy and respect.

-   Randomness, rather than personal decisions, works in choosing the respondents.

-   The respondent is entitled to privacy and the interviewer must help to ensure that privacy.

## Basics of interviewing

### Interviewer approach

-   Neutral

-   Confident

-   Impartial

-   Casual

-   Conversational

-   Friendly

## Basics of interviewing

### Interviewer conduct: Do's
